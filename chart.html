<h1>When are New Yorkers at highest risk for a fire?</h1>
<br>
	<p> By Emily Suzanne Lever

	Fires may seem like random occurrences of chaos, from wildfires in forests to buliding fires in the concrete jungle. But fires always have a cause. <br> Most wildfires, for example, are <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/study-shows-84-wildfires-caused-humans-180962315/ ">caused by human activity</a>. <br> 
	Building fires have been less studied. However, new data analysis of Emergency Response Incidents in New York City shows that fires in urban environments are not entirely random: overall they spike in colder months and fall in warmer months.

	From May, when temperatures start to get warmer (averaging <a href="https://www.ny.com/general/weather.html">71 to 53 Fahrenheit</a>), to the last gasps of the summer in October (67 to 51), the number of fires remained relatively low. But as the temperature drops, the number of fires increases, peaking at 66 per month on average in December—more than two per day.
	
	<br>
	One explanation for this variation is the increased use of heaters in colder months. According to the National Fire Protection Association, heating equipment <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/US-Fire-Problem/Decorations">accounts for 10% of all home fires</a>. (The number one cause of home fires? Candles.)
	<br> 
	Also according to the NPFA, holiday decorations and Christmas trees account for a combined 1000 fires per year, which would explain why December is the most dangerous month for fire hazards. Holidays are also frequently an occasion for home cooking—another leading cause of home fires.
	<br>
	The one outlier is February, a very cold month but also the one during which the fewest fires took place. But given that February is 28 to 29 days long, it still averaged about one fire per day.
	<br> 
	In a city of over eight million people, a handful of fires per day may seem like a negligible number—but it's still too high.
